</div>

<div style="margin-bottom:20px;">
<h5 class="tabpane-head">KEY REASONS TO STUDY MEDICINE IN CENTRAL AMERICA / THE CARIBBEAN:</h5>
<ul class="tab-panelist">
<li>Central American / Caribbean medical schools strictly follow the US Education system and curriculum and hence are focused towards preparing Physician workforce for countries like USA, Canada, etc</li>
<li>Colleges have tie ups in India offering first 6 month of foundation program in Indian Medical Colleges. It will help students to be friend with other class mates and understand the course structure in India.</li>
<li>In most Universities, students write the NBME – National Board of Medical Examiners’ examination, USA’s board examinations on completion of Basic Medical Sciences and Clinical Sciences. (In other countries, the exams are all internal or conducted by the local governments’ examination authority)
<ul>
<li>NBME is the body that conducts the board examinations for Medical students studying in the US Universities.</li>
<li>NBME is the body that conducts the USMLE examinations as well. Hence, most of these Medical universities follow 100% the same curriculum followed in USA / Canada.</li>
<li>Particularly, Pathology, Internal, Family and community Medicine modules are the same as in USA (In other countries its different)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>High standards of living; Safe, secure and peaceful environment.</li>
<li>Shorter course durations: 4 – 5.5 Years for Indian High School passed outs</li>
<li>MCAT Scores not required</li>
<li>Premedical qualification is not mandatory in few universities for Indian students with strong academic background</li>
<li>IELTS / TOEFL scores are not mandatory in most universities</li>
<li>Dedicated USMLE training / preparations during the course of study</li>
<li>Chance to do 2 Years of Clinical rotations program in teaching hospitals in USA / UK(In other countries, it can be maximum of 12weeks CLERKSHIP)</li>
<li>Chance to do Clinical rotations in Government hospitals in the Caribbean region as well.</li>
<li>100% free recognized post graduate training in USA / other developed countries on successful completion of USMLE or other respective licensing examinations with good score</li>
<li>Stipend paid during Post Graduate Education</li>
<li>Climatic conditions similar to India (temperatures ranging from 20⁰C to 32⁰C); good medical facilities also are available in the region that is a booming Medical tourism destination too.</li>
<li>1000s of Indians are settled in the region hence offering comfort and tranquility for the students. By some estimates, over 2.5 million people in the Caribbean are of Indian origin.</li>
<li>Few universities here are run by Indian managements with good number of Indian students.</li>
<li>Practical and Perfectly planned education curriculum and pattern that results in high success rates in licensing examinations(Like USMLE, MCI, PLAB, AMC etc)</li>
<li>Up to 5-10 times lesser cost than studying&nbsp;<strong>Study MBBS Abroad</strong>,&nbsp;or other major countries</li>
<li>Three intakes a year: January, April and September</li>
<li>High Visa success rate and lower documentation requirements</li>
<li>Shortage of Doctors in USA, enhances chances of Residency in USA</li>
</ul>


<p>In general terms, these universities are similar to IIT and other entrance exam Olympiad schools operating in few parts of India. Apart from imparting medical education, the universities focus completely on the licensing examination[USMLE (USA), MCCQE (Canada), PLAB (UK), AMC (Aus / NZ), etc.] and prepare the aspiring students to be successful in the same.</p>
<p>Hence the programs are career oriented, yet cost effective / value for money.</p>
<p>The Medical Universities we suggest are all recognized and approved by global bodies like</p>
<ul class="tab-panelist">
<li>MCI – Medical Council of India</li>
<li>Governments of the countries they are located in</li>
<li>ECFMG – Education Council for Foreign Medical Graduates, USA</li>
<li>FAIMER’s IMED – Foundation for Advancement of International Medical Education and Research’s International Medical Education Directory</li>
<li>ACGME – Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education – Teaching hospitals in USA</li>
<li>MCC – Medical Council of Canada</li>
<li>WHO – World Health Organization’s Avicenna Directories</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:20px;">
<h5 class="tabpane-head">PROGRAM STRUCTURE:</h5>
<p>MBBS in USA are structured such that once the students clear Step 1 of USMLE after finishing Basic Medical Sciences in Yr 2 (in some cases Yr 3) they could continue their 3rd and 4th year – Clinical studies (in few cases 4th and 5th years) in affiliated <strong>MBBS in USA </strong> (Optional). Students can do the clinical rotation in UK even without clearing PLAB/USMLE.</p>
<p>After finishing USMLE Step 1&2 with a decent score (Either in USA / UK or Central America), Students get a Temporary / Provisional License to pursue the Residency program in USA / Canada.</p>
<h4 class="tab-quote">“Residency” is an option for students to pursue Post Graduate training / Specialization in a teaching hospital in USA / Canada / UK, etc, on work based study mode. The PG program is 100% free of tuition fee. A very good stipend is paid during the program.<br>

Minimum Stipend ranges from US $ 3,500 and may be up to US $ 12,000 / Month. Students generally earn back what they have spent on their UG education within a span of 1 – 1.5 years. They also have very good chances of settling down in the countries from which the finish Residency.</h4>
<p>Further, Students who complete Residency program in USA / Canada / UK / Australia / New Zealand have additional benefits back in India too. They NEED NOT WRITE MCI SCREENING TEST IF THEY ARE COMING BACK TO INDIA TO CONTINUE THEIR PRACTICE.</p>

Sichuan University is one of the earliest institutions of higher education in China, with many predecessors, and became National Sichuan University in 1931 during the period of Republic of China. The earliest predecessor of Sichuan University is Jinjiang Shuyuan established in 1740 at Chengdu Fuxue which was originated in BCE 141 and was the first local public higher learning institution. It shared the same root with today's Chengdu Shishi High School. In 1902, Jinjiang Shuyuan, and Zunjing Shuyuan which was established in 1875, the two Chinese classical learning schools, were merged with Sichuan Zhong-Xi Xuetang (Sichuan Chinese and Western Learning School) which was established in 1896 and was a new modern type school with studies from modern western learnings, and formed Sichuan Higher School. In 1916, with the merger of Sichuan Higher School and Sichuan Higher Normal School which was established in 1905, National Chengdu Higher Normal School was founded, and it was later divided to form National Chengdu University in 1926 and National Chengdu Normal University in 1927. In 1931, by the merger of National Chengdu University, Chengdu Normal University, and the Public Sichuan University which was formed in 1927 by merger of five Sichuan provincial specialized schools, National Sichuan University was established. By 1949, Sichuan University had developed into one of the biggest national multidisciplinary universities with 6 schools, respectively in: literature, science, engineering, agriculture, law, and teacher training.</p>

<p><img src="<?= base_url()?>/assets/images/sichuan-university-3.jpg" class="img-left">In 1949, upon the nationwide adjustment of universities and colleges, spurred by the Chinese revolution, Sichuan University became a university with majors on literature, historiography, religion, mathematics, physics, biology, and other subjects. In 1958, it was the only university outside Beijing directly administered by the Central Government The former Chengdu University of Science and Technology was established as the Chengdu Engineering College in 1954 as the result of the nation-wide college and department adjustment. It specialized in chemical engineering, hydroelectricity, mechanics, textiles, and light industry.</p>
<p>Sichuan University School of Medicine was originally built as a private medical school, once known as Huaxi Xiehe College (West China Union College) and then West China University of Medical Science. It was established in 1910 by five Christian missionary groups from the U.S., UK and Canada, with offered courses in stomatology, biomedicine, basic medicine and clinical medicine. It has been a medical university in China that has enjoyed a good reputation abroad. Zhang Lan, social activist, educationist, and former Vice-Chairman of the Chinese Central Government, and Wu Yuzhang, revolutionary and educationist, were once the President of the university. Other notable people who studied at SCU include Marshal Zhu De, one of the founding fathers of the People's Republic of China and the People's Liberation Army, Guo Moruo, a literary expert and previous president of Chinese Academy of Science, and Ba Jin, a well-known Chinese author.</p>
<p>During the Cultural Revolution, large numbers of students were recruited to join various Red Guard groups, many of which were headquartered in various offices and dormitories at SCU. The campus grounds and academic institutions of the University sustained heavy damage as a result of Red Guard attacks on various structures or departments seen as representing the Four Olds or those thought to contain bad or anti-revolutionary elements, such as various members of the faculty and administration. Infighting between various Red Guard factions associated with the student body compounded the damage to campus facilities throughout the more chaotic periods of the 1960s.</p>

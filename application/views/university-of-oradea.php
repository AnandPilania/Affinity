<p><strong>A Brief Overview of Romanian Faculties of Medicine</strong><br>
Romanian medical universities offer quality education for students interested in pursuing a career in Medicine. Most of the English Medical Departments were opened in the early 90s and have since produced 1000s Medical Doctors from countries all around the world. The medical qualifications are highly recognized and graduates write the same state licensing exams as the Romanian language departments. The majorities of Romanian International Medical Universities are non-profit and is owned by the state, although they maintain autonomy in their management.</p>

<h5 class="tabpane-head">Monthly living expenses</h5>
<p>In comparison to most European cities, Oradea is very affordable.</p>
<p><strong>Includes all rotation, syllabus and assessments.</strong></p>
<p><img src="<?= base_url()?>/assets/images/university-of-oradea-6.png">All figures are dependent on how the student lives and the level of luxury they require. There are always ways to live more affordably. One may share an apartment and room, cook modest meals at home and budget carefully. Apartments further away from the city centre can be more affordable and a 2 bedroom apartment can be shared between 2 or 3 people. This will reduce the monthly services and rental expenses.</p>

<h5 class="tabpane-head">Why?</h5>
<p><strong>Problem – Shortage of medical seats and quality medical education</strong>
Around the world there is a large number of individuals who strongly desire to become Health professional like doctor and dentists. Unfortunately due to aggressive competition, shortage of seats and high entrance requirements many go without having this desire realized.</p>
<p>
<strong>Sound – Study Abroad</strong>
Often these individuals look at international medical schools as an alternative way to qualify as health professionals and find opportunities in the Caribbean, UK, IRELAND, AUSRALIA, EUROPE AND ASIA. Unfortunately these alternatives usually bring their own challenges.</p>

<p>
<strong>More challenges – Cost, competition, credibility/recognition, language barriers, strong entrance requirements and challenging environment or location of the university.</strong>
Many of these alternatives have entrance exams requiring the candidate to travel to the place of study to write an entrance exam before getting accepted. Often these schools have much higher tuition fees for foreign students than local students, which when added to the cost of living makes the total cost of study far beyond the reach of most international students.Medical Caribbean, UK, Australian and many European universities fall into this category.</p>
<p>
Newly established private universities have credibility and recognition of the qualification issues. They also have high tuition fees. Many European universities also have high tuition fees for foreign students, language issues where the program requires the candidate to learn a new language or the university is located in an environment that international students find unpleasant.
</p>
<p>
An opportunity to overcome these challenges. Study in Medicine Abroad!
